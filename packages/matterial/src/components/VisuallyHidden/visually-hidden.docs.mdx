name: Visually Hidden
description: Provides anounced text for screen readers that is not visible in other screens.

`<VisuallyHidden>` is the logical opposite of the `aria-hidden` attribute.

In the following example, screen readers will announce "Save" and will ignore the icon; the browser displays the icon and ignores the text.

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden, Icon } from 'matterial'

<button>
  <VisuallyHidden>Save</VisuallyHidden>
  <Icon icon="Download" aria-hidden />
</button>
```
